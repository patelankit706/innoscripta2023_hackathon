Short Summary === ===
The speaker is asking for an overview of the running time and discussing the importance of covering the entire project duration. They suggest classifying it under XSL cat and starting from January 1, 2023. They recommend a project duration of three to four years and mention involving the customer. They also mention learning from previous projects and the need for adjustments and optimizations.
The goal of the project is to develop genetic health evaluation products for dogs, cats, and horses. These products will allow customers to assess the overall genetic health of their animals and make informed breeding decisions. The aim is to prevent the deterioration of animal health in the future and promote healthier breeding practices.
The project aims to use high-throughput technology, specifically Next Generation Sequencing, to study the entire genetic makeup of animals and detect hereditary diseases. Currently, individual tests and smaller products are used for breed-specific applications. The project aims to expand the use of next-generation sequencing to cover a large portion of known diseases in different animal species. The goal is to develop a product for each species that contains all or most hereditary diseases and characteristics that can be mapped with the technology.
The text discusses the importance of a numerical value in an application and the methodical approach required for a scientific analysis of hereditary diseases in different species. It also mentions the need for evaluating test results and presenting them in a customer-friendly manner.
The text discusses a new product and form of diagnosis that involves comparing the Prennness to other animals. It also mentions the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for testing animals for various diseases. The text highlights the differences between individual tests and NGS, and mentions other companies offering similar packages. The author believes that NGS is something new and mentions Mars as a competitor using microarrays.
NGS offers a market advantage over competitors due to its ability to react quickly and constantly add new markers. This is because NGS is a fast-moving product that is researched intensively. Compared to microarrays, NGS allows for faster reactions to customer needs. Reacting within one to two months is possible with NGS, while it can take three to six months with microarrays. This time advantage is a clear market advantage for NGS.
The text discusses the differentiation between Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) used for genetic fingerprinting in dogs and NGS used for investigating hereditary diseases. NGS for genetic fingerprinting examines positions in the genome that have no effect on the animal's health, while NGS for hereditary diseases focuses on specific positions that trigger the disease. The analysis for hereditary diseases is more complex and involves examining a larger number of SNPs and other mutations.
The analysis of hereditary diseases is complex and requires a higher level of security. Identifying an animal based on 230 SNPs can still have uncertainties. The presence of hereditary diseases has a significant impact on the animal. The last chapter discusses technical risks and the challenges of detecting mutations and insertions in the genome.
The text discusses the challenges of sequencing DNA due to repeats and remnants of viral DNA, making it difficult to analyze larger deletions and insertions. However, a new procedure called structural variant analysis allows for the evaluation of long insertions and deletions using multiple primers. This procedure is seen as a positive development in DNA analysis. Evaluating and characterizing DNA insertions with Next Generation Sequencing is not considered a major risk, but rather an isolated case. The goal is to cover 60 percent of hereditary diseases, focusing on the most relevant ones.
The text discusses the importance of including critical hereditary diseases in tests and justifying the inability to detect them due to factors like DNA complexity. It also mentions the need to mention expenses and personnel involved in the application. The conversation concludes with plans to work on the application and distribute it through email and an accompanying portal.
The conversation discusses a project on antibiotic resistance and bacterial infections. They clarify that Leishmania resistance is a different topic. They plan to name it Leishmania resistance and continue with screen splitting for better organization. The project started in the middle of last year and will run for three years. Leishmania is a parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, causing leishmaniasis in dogs and potentially in humans. Climate change is causing the mosquitoes to spread further north, posing a future problem in Germany.
The goal is to develop a tool for veterinarians to determine the best drug for treating dogs with Leishmania. By studying the resistance genes in Leishmania samples, the researchers aim to identify which drugs are most effective. They will use Next Generation Sequencing to examine the entire Leishmania genome and compare their findings with existing scientific publications. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of resistance genes and make the tool more attractive by considering all relevant genes.
The text discusses the use of Next Generation Sequencing to analyze gene variations in Leishmania and identify resistance to drugs. It mentions the use of questionnaires, consultation with veterinarians, and in vitro tests to evaluate drug effectiveness. The text also highlights the challenge of determining a gold standard for resistance and suggests aiming for an 80 percent agreement with veterinarian assessments.
The text discusses the use of NLGS and classical methods for detecting resistances in Leishmania infections. Currently, veterinarians rely on medication adjustments based on observation and measurement of leishmania load. NGS has been used for basic research but not yet commercially. The differentiation of technologies is also mentioned, with the focus on detecting Leishmania and resistance genes through NGS.
The text discusses the use of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to examine animal samples and isolate Leishmania parasites. The goal is to characterize parasites from animal material using NGS. The risks include the presence of multiple strains within one animal, potential errors in publications, and the challenge of adapting preparations for parasite DNA. The sensitivity of detecting resistance genes is also mentioned. Possible solutions include separating genomic DNA using Nanopore's methods or growing Leishmania in a cell culture for further examination.
The conversation discusses the number of people needed for a project, potential subcontractors, and the need for cooperation with universities. They also touch on the topic of screening methods for diseases in animals and the limitations of these methods.
The speaker discusses the concept of mutation and its impact on hereditary diseases. They mention an ongoing prototype project and the need to expand it with new developments. They express uncertainty about dedicating enough time to the project and plan to discuss alternative approaches with their department head. The speaker concludes the conversation by thanking the other person and wishing them a nice week.
