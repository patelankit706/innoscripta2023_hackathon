The text provides insights into the differentiation between Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques used for genetic fingerprinting in dogs and NGS techniques used for investigating hereditary diseases. In the case of genetic fingerprinting, NGS examines positions in the genome known as SNPs, which have no impact on the animal's health, age, or lifestyle. A scientific committee has selected around 100 to 300 SNPs to identify an animal uniquely. On the other hand, NGS for hereditary diseases follows a different approach. It first identifies the specific genetic trigger for the disease and then investigates that particular position. Typically, one to three positions per hereditary disease are examined, and the results are integrated to obtain the final outcome. This approach is more complex than genetic fingerprinting as it involves mapping the complex biology of hereditary diseases, including SNPs and other mutations like insertions, deletions, and large duplications. The analysis for hereditary diseases is aimed at determining whether a specific condition is indeed a hereditary disease. Overall, the text highlights the differences in methodology and complexity between NGS for genetic fingerprinting and NGS for investigating hereditary diseases.
The analysis of hereditary diseases involves complex considerations, particularly regarding the identification process. While the identification of an animal based on 230 SNPs may seem reliable, there is still a level of uncertainty involved. The presence of hereditary diseases greatly affects the animal's well-being and requires utmost accuracy. The last chapter delves into the assessment of technical risks, specifically focusing on the challenges associated with detecting mutations and insertions in the genome. Mutations that are not single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) pose a significant risk, as they may go undetected due to various factors such as wider fingers or errors in detection. Additionally, insertions and deletions in the genome present difficulties in determining their impact on disease development. Integrating such complexities into Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology is extremely challenging. Overall, the analysis and understanding of hereditary diseases demand meticulous attention to detail and a comprehensive approach to mitigate risks.
The text highlights the limitations of DNA sequencing caused by low informative value, repeats, and remnants of viral DNA. These factors make it challenging to analyze larger deletions, insertions, and complex variations. However, a new procedure called structural variant analysis, involving the integration of multiple primers, offers a solution for evaluating long insertions and deletions. This development is considered a significant advancement in DNA analysis. The text also addresses the difficulty of evaluating and characterizing DNA insertions using Next Generation Sequencing. While not a major risk, it is seen as an isolated case. The focus is on covering 60 percent of hereditary diseases, prioritizing those with frequent occurrence and significant effects on animals and breeding processes.
