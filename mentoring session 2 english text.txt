Q1
The objective of this project is to develop a tool for identifying and characterizing genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), in Leishmania samples. Currently, there are no general guidelines on how to explore and interpret the impact of aneuploidy in Leishmania genomes, which poses challenges for researchers and bioinformaticians in their analyses.The project aims to utilize Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology to study the entire Leishmania genome, providing valuable insights into its genetic diversities and complexity. This will expand the state of knowledge in Leishmania genomics and contribute to the understanding of gene regulation and chromosomal copy number variation. By examining the genomic DNA of Leishmania samples, the project will identify and characterize resistance genes. This analysis will shed light on the mechanisms of gene regulation and chromosomal copy number variation in Leishmania. The sensitivity of the investigation is targeted at achieving an 80% agreement with the resistance identified by veterinarians.The planned outcome of the project is to equip researchers and veterinarians with a tool that can accurately detect genetic variations in Leishmania, potentially improving the selection of appropriate medications for the treatment of Leishmaniasis.

Q2
The project involves various tasks including the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of Leishmania genomes, the identification of genetic variations, and the impact of aneuploidy on genome analyses. Tasks also involve setting up computational environments for genome analyses and characterizing genetic variations among Leishmania samples. The project also focuses on the differentiation of our technologies from existing ones, primarily centered on resistance detection. A novel approach is employed in this regard, extending NGS from basic research to commercial application for the diagnosis of Leishmania resistance.By analyzing scientific publications and consulting with veterinarians, the project aims to characterize these resistance genes and determine their correlation with specific drugs. The investigation will involve searching for copy number variations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Leishmania genome. By utilizing NGS, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the complexity of the Leishmania genome and gene regulation.

Q3
This project targets the veterinary industry, specifically the diagnosis and treatment of Leishmania infections. It aims to surpass current techniques in terms of accuracy and speed. Existing methods for studying Leishmania involve using classical PCA or real-time PCA to detect Leishmania in various sample materials, but these lack the capability to detect resistance genes. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has been employed to study different strains of Leishmania and perform epidemiological studies, but its application has been primarily in basic research and not yet commercialized. This project leverages NGS to examine the entire Leishmania genome and uses questionnaires and consultations with veterinarians to identify resistance genes and determine the most effective drugs. It also employs in vitro tests to evaluate Leishmania’s response to certain drugs, and biochemical approaches to ascertain the connection between the drug and changes in the genome. The goal is to achieve an 80% agreement with veterinarians’ assessment of resistance.

Q4
The current technology used in our company primarily involves individual tests and smaller products for breed-specific DNA profiling and parentage analyses. In contrast, the Leishmania disease project introduces the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for studying the entire genetic makeup of an animal, a novel approach within our operations. The project plans to expand the use of NGS beyond basic research and into commercial applications for detecting hereditary diseases in cats, dogs, and horses. This new methodology will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of animal health, with a focus on larger genetic variants, thereby expanding our existing knowledge base. Such a significant shift from established methods necessitates extensive development and testing, going beyond routine activities in our company.

Q5
Multiple Strains within One Animal: Animals often carry different Leishmania strains, some of which may be resistant while others are not. This may affect the accuracy of the detection of resistance genes. To address this, we aim to develop a methodology capable of mapping all variants.

Incorrect Publications: The project heavily relies on existing scientific publications to locate resistance genes. If these are incorrect, it could lead to false results and misinterpretation of data. We plan to cross-verify the information from publications with our own research findings.

High Genomic DNA Background: The presence of too much genomic DNA in the sample could impede the sensitivity of the resistance genes' detection. We aim to adapt our sample preparation to separate parasite DNA and, if necessary, explore cell culturing.

Aneuploidy and Genetic Variability: The presence of frequent aneuploidy in Leishmania genomes poses a unique challenge in characterizing and interpreting read depth and somy in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analyses. The accurate detection of genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), is affected by read depth. However, there are no general guidelines on exploring and interpreting the impact of aneuploidy, making it challenging for biologists and bioinformaticians to perform their own analyses and interpret results across different studies.

Lack of Guidelines: There is a lack of general guidelines on how to perform Leishmania NGS analyses. This presents a challenge, especially for beginners, in setting up a computational environment for genome analyses, characterizing genetic variations, and understanding the impact of chromosomal copy number variation on genome analyses. The absence of guidelines hinders the reproducibility and comparability of research findings.

Interpretation of Results: Another risk is the potential discrepancy between the genes identified in scientific publications and their clinical relevance. While there are publications on genes associated with resistance, it is crucial to validate their significance in clinical practice. Incorrect interpretations of results may lead to ineffective treatment decisions and the development of more resistant Leishmania strains.
